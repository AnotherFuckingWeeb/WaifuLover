                    <h2>About Satania</h2>
                    <p>
                        Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell or Satania for short is a dimwitted demon who often thinks of petty ways to cause mischief which usually end in failure. She is often pestered by both Raphiel and the dog. Satania is considered as a minor antagonist while she is also one of the four main characters and protagonists.

                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Satania generally wears her school uniform, consisting of: a short, red and black plaid skirt, a red neck tie with an upside down white cross, dark grey knee high socks with 2 white stripes at the top of each, a dark grey shirt, brown jacket with 5 buttons and 2 pockets (1 on each side), and finally brown shoes. A black hairband and black open winged, bat-shaped hair clip can be noticed upon her red hair as well. She has red/pinkish eyes.

                        She does dress differently, however, within the opening for the anime, and that outfit is while she is a demon. It consists of a long black corset styled dress with fluffy fabric blooming out from below. A few red seam lines on the corset part, and a white chest piece fabric attached to the black lace choker.

                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>
                        Satania's personality may come from her family who are successful bakery owners, prideful and think of themselves as nobility who are higher than the common folks (with the exception of her brother, who is surprisingly far more rational and realistic). Satania herself is also full of pride, typical for a demon.

                        Her pride however brings serious repercussions in the human world, where she became socially awkward and lonely. Other than her group, Satania seems to have no other friends. It also prevents her from rational thinking and common sense view. Which makes her very naive and gullible like a child and to an extent as innocent as one (very uncommon for a demon). This naivety is the reason why Raphi capable of manipulating her very easily and Gab can outsmart her every time.
